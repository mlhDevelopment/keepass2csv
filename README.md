keepass2csv  -  README
=====================
keepass2csv.xsl

Convert KeePass XML (2.x) format to CSV, columns tailored to 1Password's CSV import

Usage
  Either:
  a) - Export from Keepass 2 to XML
     - Apply xsl to exported xml (e.g with Notepad++, Plugins->XML tools->XSL Transformation)
  b) Apply xsl directly from Keepass 2 (File->Export->Transform using XSL Template).
  
  Notes: * Notes lists "From KeePass conversion" on all entries
         * The original keepass "folder" is stored into Notes, along with the icon that was used.
